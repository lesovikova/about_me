            Hey, traveller! You are welcome to sit at my campfire with me. My
            name is Goringa, I'm a hunter of great skill and renown from the
            land of Shire which is in Middle-Earth. It's a dark time for all the
            lands now, for the war with great evil has started and all the free
            peoples has come together to battle it. I'm a fast traveller and
            volunteered to get help from other lands and so I'm here.
          </p>

            The land of the Shire has always been a peacefull one and I never
            expected to leave it. But one evening as I was walking with my
            friends, we were kidnapped by black riders, I understand now that
            they mistook us for the hobbits that were travelling with one by the
            name of Baggins. We were brought to the place near Bree town and
            probably would have been torchured horribly, but I man called
            Strider came to our help. We fought side by side to get out of that
            place and he offered me to enter into a training with some of his
            brethren. That's how I learned to be a hunter, it was an arduous
            training, a lot of skills I have aquired only much later. I'm
            skilled in tracking men, beasts and even evil spirits, can travel
            great distances extremely fast and of course, skilled with the bow
            and arrow.

            My travels and help with the great battle has taken me to many
            places, there isn't a land in Eriador where I haven't stepped foot.
            I'm been to fair Rivendell, have seen the great lake of Evendim,
            battled foul creatures in Anmar and even went through Moria where
            it's so easy to get lost. I've become kindred to many peoples and
            helped them with my skill or just with a good word. My main camp now
            is in Dol Amroth in Gondor and soon I'll be in a hurry to return
            thither.
